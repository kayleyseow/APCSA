Savitsky-Golay Filter Test

Supplemental information for HyperGrade SavitskyGolayFilterTest.

Start by reading the HyperGrade problem description.

Here is what the HyperGrade test data in analytic form looks like using a graphing utility:

 

In the left plot, the red curve shows the parabola and the green curve shows the Gaussian (you might have to enlarge – it’s the tiny blip in the green curve along the x-axis at x = 400).

In the right plot, the blue curve shows the sum of the parabola and the Gaussian (again, note the tiny blip at x = 400).  The purple curve is the first derivative of the blue curve.

These plots demonstrate how a derivative can reveal a subtle but significant feature in undifferentiated data, which otherwise might be missed entirely.

Analytic graphing utilities, however, cannot handle real-world digitized data – that is the purpose of your program.  You will start by reproducing the above results using a digitized version of the same idealized test data.

Below is what your Drawing Panel output should look like.  For this idealized data, it is not necessary to smooth the data.   Use filter 8 to take the first derivative.  As explained in HyperGrade, scale the first derivative curve by a factor of 4 to improve visualization.

 

Submit your code on HyperGrade (there are no cases) and your Drawing Panel plot on Google Classroom.

Once performance is confirmed, we will proceed to analyze some real-world data.
