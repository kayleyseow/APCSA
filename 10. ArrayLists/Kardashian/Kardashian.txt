Use the following code to answer the questions below and learn about comparable interface and compareTo:
public class Kardashian implements Comparable<Kardashian> {
	public String name;
	public int eyebrowLength;
	public double nailLength;
}
Write a compareTo method for the class above. The method should 
first compare by name, then by eyebrowLength, then by nailLength.
Write a method that takes an arraylist of Kardashians as input, 
sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted arraylist.
