The farmer adds crops to his field every month. (note that 
the field has no predetermined size). Each time the farmer adds a 
crop, the farmer always adds it to the right of the crop he last 
planted (along the row). The farmer may decide to add one, two, or 
even three crops each month. 

On the mth month where m is divisible by an integer l, the farmer 
will always add a legume crop to his farm, denoted by L. 

In the mth month where m is divisible by an integer c, the farmer 
will always add a corn crop to his farm, denoted as C. 

On the mth month where m is divisible by an integer r, the farmer 
will always add a rice crop to his farm, denoted as R. 

On the mth month where m is divisible by an integer k, the farmer 
decides that there are too many crops on the given row, and 
decides to switch over to the next row, which happens to lie just 
under the previous row. 

If multiple crops are to be planted at the same time, the order to 
plant them is legumes, corn, then rice. If in a certain month, crops 
are to be planted and rows are also to be changed, change the row 
first before planting the crop. 

Write a method that takes inputs for l, c, r, k, and the number of 
months m. Return an arraylist of char arraylists that contains the 
positions of the crops on the farmerâ€™s field.
