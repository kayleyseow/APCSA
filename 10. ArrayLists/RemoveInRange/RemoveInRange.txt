Write a class called RemoveInRange that accepts three parameters - an ArrayList of
strings, a beginning string, and an ending string - and removes from the list any
strings that fall alphabetically between the start and end strings, inclusively.

You can assume that all strings are lower case.

For example, if your method is passed a list containing the elements

[how, to, get, over, the, hill, without, getting, to, the, top],

"fast" as the start string and "talk" as the end string, the list's elements
should be changed to

[to, the, without, to, the, top].

Assume that the start string precedes the end string alphabetically.

Have the user input strings from the console to populate your ArrayList. The end of
user input for your ArrayList should be signified by the user entering the String value
"lastString" followed by a return. Your code need not be robust.

Bonus opportunity(s):  create a sentence and a range such that an "interesting" new
sentence or phrase results. Example: might be a question, from which
the answer emerges after processing by RemoveInRange.
