Write a program called Count that takes an ArrayList of strings and lists the number
of occurrences of unique strings as an arrayList in ascending order. You can asume the
list of strings is in alphabetical order. Examples:

[be, be, is, not, or, the, to, to] becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2] because is, not, or and the
each occur once while be and to occur twice

[a, a, a, a, a] becomes [5].

Make your comparisons case insensitive, i.e.

[a, a, A, a, a] also becomes [5].

Have the user input strings from the console to populate your ArrayList.  Assume that
the user enters only String values in alphabetical order. Use the sentinal "lastString"
to signify the end of user input. Your code need not be robust.
