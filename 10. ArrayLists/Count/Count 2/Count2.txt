Write a class called Count2 that takes an ArrayList of strings separated
by spaces until the sentinel string, lastString, is encountered. Note: Unlike
Count, the list of strings is not necessarily in alphabetical order. The class
should list the number of instances of each unique term next to each term, in
ascending order of occurence. If two terms have the same number of occurences,
the term that appears first in the original list should show up first.  Assume
that the user enters only lower case strings.

Example:
input:
a b b a c c c lastString
output:
a 2
b 2
c 3
Using maps is not allowed.
