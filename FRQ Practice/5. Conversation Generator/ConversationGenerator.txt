/*
Your stats assignment requires you to talk to people and ask them a list of questions, but you do not feel like doing this. Luckily, you have found a text-to-speech translator, making it possible for you to type your questions beforehand so that everything happens automatically. You do not want it to be too obvious that you are not there in person, so you prepare some starters, acknowledgements, and enders in addition to the questions. Your starters, enders, and acknowledgements are to be randomly choosen.
*
* You decide on a conversation format as follows:

* Random starter

* Question 1
* <Get response>
* Random achnowledgement (repeats allowed)

* Question 2
* <Get response>
* Random achnowledgement (repeats allowed)

* Question 3
* <Get response>
* Random achnowledgement (repeats allowed)

* Question 4
* <Get response>
* Random achnowledgement (repeats allowed)

* Question 5
* <Get response>
* Random achnowledgement (repeats allowed)

* Question 6
* <Get response>
* Random achnowledgement (repeats allowed)

* Question 7
* <Get response>
* Random achnowledgement (repeats allowed)

* Question 8
* <Get response>
* Random achnowledgement (repeats allowed)

* Question 9
* <Get response>
* Random achnowledgement (repeats allowed)

* Question 10
* <Get response>
* Random achnowledgement (repeats allowed)

* Random ender
