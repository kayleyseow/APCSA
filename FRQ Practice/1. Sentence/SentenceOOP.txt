/*
Write a client program SentenceOOPClient.java and class SentenceOOP that
implements SentenceProblem in an OOP context, as originally intended. Your
client program should take in a sentence from the user, construct a
SentenceOOP object, access the methods getBlankPositions(), countWords(),
and getWords() in your SentenceOOP class, and print out the result.

Your SentenceOOP class should declare a String variable which will hold
the sentence, provide a constructor for the sentence, and provide the
three methods getBlankPositions(), countWords(), and getWords().

SentenceOOPClient.java will function exactly like SentenceStatic.java,
but internally will utilize explicit OOP. Static methods may be more
efficient at runtime (fewer parameters and no overhead to create and
destroy objects), whereas OOP groups cohesive methods into into a
a modular class, attractive from an organizational standpoint.
