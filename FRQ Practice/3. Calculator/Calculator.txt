/*
You're at one hour before the AP Calculus test, and your calculator has stopped
working. Luckily, you have a programmable Arduino next to you. All you have time
for is basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. You try quickly
to write the code, but in your haste spill coffee all over your keyboard. Now,
the * and / keys are not working. Furthermore, the + and - keys behave like they
are on caffeine highs and produce ++ and -- only, not + and -.

Implement iterative methods to rescue you from your coffee spill.
Extra credit oportunity: implement recursive methods.

Take in two positive integers from the user, space separated. While both integers
will be >= 1, the first is not necessarily larger than the second.

Input/output example:

Enter two integers, space separated: 
4 5
9
-1
20
0

	/* Input: 2 integers
