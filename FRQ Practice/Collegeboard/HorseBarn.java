/*
Consider a software system that models a horse barn. Classes that represent horses implement the following interface.
A horse barn consists of N numbered spaces. Each space can hold at most one horse. The spaces are indexed starting from 0; the index of the last space is N â€“ 1. No two horses in the barn have the same name.
The declaration of the HorseBarn class is shown below. You will write two unrelated methods of the HorseBarn class.
a.
Write the HorseBarn method findHorseSpace. This method returns the index of the space in which the horse with the specified name is located. If there is no horse with the specified name in the barn, the method returns -1.
b. 
Write the HorseBarn method consolidate. This method consolidates the barn by moving horses so that the horses are in adjacent spaces, starting at index 0, with no empty spaces between any two horses. After the barn is consolidated, the horses are in the same order as they were before the consolidation.

	//Precondition: No two horses in the barn have the same name.
