This is an exercise to familiarize you with maps.
Documentation can be found here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html

Imagine that you have a piece of text, and you want to count the number of occurrences of each
word. Fortunately, Bob has already counted all the words for you, and he is providing the data
as N strings with their respective counts. 

However, he was doing this at 4 AM and he forgot a bunch of words. He then recounted and provided
counts of the forgotten words as K strings and their respective counts. 

Bob also has a set of Q favorite words, and he wants to know the total number of occurrences of
his favorite words. In other words, he wants the sum of the counts of each of the Q words. Please
output this sum modulo 10^9 + 7.

You will be given 3 integers: N, the number of elements in the map, K, the number of forgotten
words, and Q, the number of favorite words. You will be given N lines, each with a word and a count,
then K lines, each with a word and a count, and finally Q lines, each with a single word.

Example Input:
3 2 1
i 1
like 1
chicken 1
chicken 30
i 23
chicken

In this case, he originally sees 1 "i", 1 "like", and 1 "chicken". He then realizes he forgot 30
"chicken" and 23 "i". His only favorite word is chicken, so the output would be 31.
For some test cases, your implementation may need to use long rather than int.
