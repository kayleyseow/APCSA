I think this should go without saying, but **please do not copy anything from this repository and turn it in as your own work**. Not only is it extremely academically dishonest 
(M.O.S.S.ing is a thing, just in case you did not know), but it is also not the right way to learn how to code. The only way you will properly learn is by coding and completing 
your own assignments and projects on your own. If you are struggling with understanding any concepts, I am sure your instructor or TA will be more than happy to help you out. The 
only reason I am including this here is because I do not want you to get in trouble, and furthermore, I do not want to get in trouble either. I decided to make my repository 
public because when I took the test myself, I found it hard to find accurate solutions to Collegeboard's released FRQ's, and because when I learned how to code, I looked to other 
public repositories for help on syntax conventions and good Java coding practices — in a way, I am just doing my best to pay it forward to others.  

**So in short, please DO NOT copy my work — it will do nothing more than harm you in the long run. Simply put, it is not the right way to learn how to code.**  

Best of luck on your Java and APCSA journey, and thank you for reading.
