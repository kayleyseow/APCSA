## About  
This repository has complete coursework for my APCSA class, including all my code, notes, and projects. My repository is divided into 14 different folders. 13 are for different topics and chapters that were covered during class, and 1 is dedicated solely to APCSA Free Response Question practice. Unless otherwise stated, all code is written by me. If you want to take a look at my winter break project for this class, the Digital Ruler, you may do so [here](https://github.com/kayleyseow/Digital-Ruler).  

One more thing before you continue on — this repository is quite sentimental to me. This contains every single line of code and every single program I wrote for this class, from my first ever, HelloWorld.java, to more complicated programs using recursion and even things like Java Graphics. I was able to grow so much as a student and programmer, and I hope you all will be able to see that progression through my programs and materials as well. Huge shoutout to my teacher, TA, and classmates, I really could not have done it without you all.
